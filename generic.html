									</header>
									<p style="font-size: large;">Hello, I’m Purshottam Singh Thakur, born on August 26, 2004, and raised in the vibrant city of Indore, India. From a young age, I was captivated by the wonders of science, which initially led me to dream of a career in astrophysics. However, during my high school years, I experienced a transformative shift in my career aspirations when I encountered the field of computer science—a change that has profoundly shaped my professional journey.

										My interest in computer science was sparked by its unique problem-solving nature. Unlike many fields, computer science constantly presents new and complex problems that require innovative thinking and adaptability. This intellectual challenge resonates with my love for mathematics, where solving intricate problems and adapting to new scenarios is a core aspect. The parallels between the problem-solving processes in computer science and calculus were particularly compelling to me.
										
										A pivotal moment in my journey was the influence of my high school computer science professor. His enthusiasm for the subject and his engaging teaching methods made programming an exciting and accessible challenge. Thanks to his mentorship, I developed a genuine passion for coding, transforming it from a mere academic requirement into an enjoyable and stimulating pursuit.
										
										Currently, I am pursuing a bachelor’s degree in computer science at The University of Toledo, where I am committed to deepening my expertise and honing my skills. My focus is on addressing complex problems in software engineering, with a particular interest in artificial intelligence. My goal is to leverage my growing knowledge to make significant contributions to the field of AI and create innovative solutions to challenging problems.
										
										Beyond my academic endeavors, I actively engage in solving Java practice problems on CodeChef and participate in their weekly global programming contests. This practice has sharpened my algorithmic problem-solving skills and enhanced my analytical abilities, which are crucial for developing efficient software solutions. My current rank of 362 in my country reflects my dedication and progress in this area.
										
										In addition, I am expanding my skill set by learning Android app development through online courses and hands-on projects. This endeavor is broadening my capabilities in mobile application development, positioning me for future opportunities in the growing tech industry.
										
										As I continue to advance in my studies and professional development, I am driven by the ambition to make a meaningful impact in the field of computer science. My aim is to solve complex software engineering challenges and contribute to the advancement of artificial intelligence, leaving a lasting legacy in a field that I am deeply passionate about.</p>
